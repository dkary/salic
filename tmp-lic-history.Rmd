## Prep

```{r}
data("sale", package = "salic")
data("lic", package = "salic")

sale_unranked <- select(lic, lic_id, duration) %>%
    right_join(sale) %>%
    select(cust_id, year, duration)
sale_ranked <- rank_sale(sale_unranked)
```

## Functions

```{r}
### todo
# 1. organize new functions in lichist.R, and leave deprecated funcs in summary.R, etc.
# - make_lic_history()
# - identify_R3()
# - identify_lapse()
# note: probably no need for a new make_priv() function

# 3. consider specific cases
# - when a lifetime should only count for 1 year, should it count as churned next year???
# - this will be part of identify_lapse()
# 4. work on documentation
# - data structure whould be intuitive & easy to check for accuracy
# - code should be understandable (as simple as possible) & updateable

# yrs = 2004:2013

## Test

```{r}
sale_ranked$res <- sample(c(1,0,NA), nrow(sale_ranked), replace = T) # to test "carry_vars"
lic_history <- make_lic_history(sale_ranked, 2004:2013, "res")

# check - visual
g <- filter(lic_history, has_priv) %>%
    ggplot(aes(factor(year))) + 
    geom_bar(aes(fill = factor(duration_run)))
ggplotly(g)

# check with tables
check_history_summary(lic_history)
check_history_samp(lic_history)
```
