Todo:
1. Don't do lazy loading of sample data (to easy to operate on sample data)
2. Apply WI changes to salic (Rmds mostly)
3. Work on vignette
4. Work on updating code (Rmd + functions perhaps) and vignette


OLDER STUFF - take a look at this for reference
1. work on (make.R) functions, see corresponding functions in saproj
-  (done) new()
-  (done) section()
-  others...? > not now but maybe later > work on WI scripts first

2. Modify some customer checking functions (for WI) to shown more info
-  customer distributions, with typical values
-  cust_summary_demo(), check_fields(), etc.
-  do similar with sales and license checking functions (if needed)

3. Add examples and finish 1-make-priv.R
- Write a vignette
- (maybe) functions for summarizing results (e.g., churn)
  - (probably isn't really necessary since it's basically querying a table)


FUNCTION ORGANIZATION:
- import.R      (maybe) for getting license data into R
- import-check.R

- reshape.R     for reshaping the data into a related format (cust, sale, lic)
- reshape-check.R
- validate.R    for validating license data

- summarize.R   for summarizing license history to easily calculate R3, churn
                (specifically - making a privilege table with lapse & R3 variables)
- summarize-check.R
