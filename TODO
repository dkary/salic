Todo:
- (probably) remove state-specific templates from the included files, maybe place in saproj or somewhere else (may also want to completely remove any saproj dependency...but then need to update analyst documentation)

1. Complete Rmd templates
2. Write vignette (just an initial, creating directory, intializing w/templates)

Big Todo: Updating license data (e.g., new quarters/years)
Update workflow
- first run OR through a new "first-year" process with changes above
- write update workflow scripts (maybe with some auto-populate templates)
- use last update as a reference, probably keep changes small
