Todo:
IMPORTANT: change new_section_yr1() so that individual files can't be overwritten
Finish templates in 1-prep-license-data (this is currently incomplete and confusing)

1. Improve "4-dashboard-results", probably with some ggplot visuals at least
2. Work on vignette (just an initial, creating directory, intializing w/templates)

Priorities: Address largest time bottlenecks
1. basic Rmd templates with auto-populating functions in salic
   - 1-prep-license
   - 4-dashboard-results (should improve OR update code)
   - run OR "first-year" through the above
2. More generic priv structure (lic_priv table)
   - probably use this for OR > add new column for bow vs. rifle
3. Update workflow
   - first run OR through a new "first-year" process with changes above
   - write update workflow scripts (maybe with some auto-populate templates)
   - use last update as a reference, probably keep changes small

OLDER STUFF - take a look at this for reference
1. work on (make.R) functions, see corresponding functions in saproj
-  (done) new()
-  (done) section()
-  others...? > not now but maybe later > work on WI scripts first

2. Modify some customer checking functions (for WI) to shown more info
-  customer distributions, with typical values
-  cust_summary_demo(), check_fields(), etc.
-  do similar with sales and license checking functions (if needed)

3. Add examples and finish 1-make-priv.R
- Write a vignette
- (maybe) functions for summarizing results (e.g., churn)
  - (probably isn't really necessary since it's basically querying a table)


FUNCTION ORGANIZATION:
- import.R      (maybe) for getting license data into R
- import-check.R

- reshape.R     for reshaping the data into a related format (cust, sale, lic)
- reshape-check.R
- validate.R    for validating license data

- summarize.R   for summarizing license history to easily calculate R3, churn
                (specifically - making a privilege table with lapse & R3 variables)
- summarize-check.R
