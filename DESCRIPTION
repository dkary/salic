Description: A set of functions for getting license data into a standard format
    that facilitates further analysis (churn, R3, etc.). Much of this functionality
    was built for producing state data dashboards, originally developed under the
    leadership of the Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies R3
    Committee. Chris Willard at Oregon Dept of Fish and Wildlife spearheaded
    the initial effort to develop graphical "scorecards", which evolved into
    interactive data dashboards.
