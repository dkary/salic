# salic

A set of functions for summarizing wildlife agency data for data dashboards, originally developed under the leadership of the Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies R3 Committee.

## Installation

Binary installers are included (here)

## Usage

Might make sense to link to the vignette here (to be written), could show some basics as well.

```r
'vignette("salic")'
```
