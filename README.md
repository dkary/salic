# salic: An R Package to Prepare Agency Dashboard Data

This R package includes a set of functions for summarizing agency data for dashboards, developed under the leadership of the Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies.

## Installation

You'll need a version of R installed (version 3.5.0 or greater). Binary installers are included (here)

## Usage

Might make sense to link to the vignette here (to be written), could show some basics as well.

```r

```
