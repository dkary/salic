data("sale", package = "salic")
data("lic", package = "salic")

sale_unranked <- select(lic, lic_id, duration) %>%
    right_join(sale) %>%

sale_ranked <- rank_sale(sale_unranked)

## New Workflow

```{r}
summary_sale(sale_ranked)
```

### Make License History

```{r}
lic_history <- make_lic_history(sale_ranked, yrs, "res")
check_carry_vars(lic_history, sale_ranked, "res")

# check - visual
g <- ggplot_lic_history(lic_history, yrs, "duration_run")
ggplotly(g)

# check with tables
check_history_summary(lic_history)
check_history_samp(lic_history)
```

### Identify R3

```{r}
lic_history <- identify_R3(lic_history, yrs)

# check overall
g <- ggplot_lic_history(lic_history, yrs, "R3")
ggplotly(g)

# check R3 coding
check_identify_R3(lic_history)
check_history_samp(lic_history)
```

### Identify Lapse
```{r}
lic_history <- identify_lapse(lic_history, yrs)

# check overall
g <- ggplot_lic_history(lic_history, yrs, "lapse")
ggplotly(g)

# check lapse coding
check_identify_lapse(lic_history)
check_history_samp(lic_history)
```

### Finalize Priv

```{r}
priv <- lic_history %>%
    filter(has_priv) %>%
    select(cust_id, year, R3, lapse, res)

# summarize
R3_labs <- c("Carried", "Retained", "Reactivated", "Recruited")
x <- mutate(priv, R3 = factor(R3, levels = 1:4, labels = R3_labs))

check_make_priv_final(x)
group_by(x, res) %>% check_make_priv_final()
```

## Original Workflow

```{r}
# compare to original formulation
track <- salic::make_track(sale_ranked, yrs)
salic::check_make_track(track, sale)

priv <- salic::make_priv(track)
R3_rows <- filter(priv[[length(priv)]], !is.na(R3)) %>% nrow()
if (R3_rows > 0) salic::check_make_priv(priv)

priv <- priv %>% salic::make_priv_final(
    keep = c("cust_id", "year", "lapse", "R3", "res")
)

# note - it might be worth leaving the check_make_priv_final function as is
mutate(priv, R3 = factor(R3, levels = 1:4, 
       labels = c("Carried", "Retained", "Reactivated", "Recruited"))) %>%
    check_make_priv_final()

# check visual
z <- count(priv, R3, year)
ggplot(z, aes(year, n, fill = R3)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity")
```
