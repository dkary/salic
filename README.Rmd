# salic

salic is an R package for preparing and summarizing agency data. In particular, it aims to simplify the production of national/regional dashboards by providing a set of functions that work across state agencies.

## Installation

- First, install R: https://www.r-project.org/
- Then install salic and it's dependencies:

``` r
# Install dependencies
install.packages(c("dplyr", "data.table"))

# Install salic from binary executables
# TEMP NOTE: I'll replace these with actual links before sending to partners
install.packages("bla bla") # for Windows 
install.packages("bla bla") # for Mac

# Alternatively, install salic from source
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("southwick-associates/salic")
```

## Usage

See [the vignette](https://southwick-associates.github.io/salic/articles/salic.html) for an introduction.

A template workflow for national/regional dashboards is available at https://github.com/southwick-associates/dashboard-template

### Example: fishing participation

Using `rank_sale()`, `make_history()`, and `est_part()`

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(salic)

# load data
data(lic, sale)

# build license history
history <- lic %>% 
    filter(type %in% c("fish", "combo")) %>% 
    inner_join(sale, by = "lic_id") %>% 
    rank_sale() %>% 
    make_history(yrs = 2008:2018)

# count total participants
est_part(history)
```
